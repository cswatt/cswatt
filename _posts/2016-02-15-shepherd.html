<p>Jean Shepherd was entertained, despite everything. At the start of 1956, his radio show had been moved to a 1 am timeslot, and the station didn’t want to keep its Manhattan studio open during those hours, so now he sat sweating behind a microphone in an unventilated, austere brick rectangle of a building in Cateret, New Jersey, next to a 50,000-watt transmitter that generated so much heat that he had stripped down to a pair of shorts.
</p>

<p>
He was entertained because, according to his cadre of faithful listeners—the motley of graveyard-shift workers, insomniacs, and obsessives who tuned in during the wee hours—a new book named I, Libertine had become New York society’s most recent literary craze.
</p>
<p>
I, Libertine was the first volume of a trilogy of books about 18th century English court life, printed by Excelsior Press, a subsidiary of Cambridge University Press. The author, Frederick Roland Ewing, was a retired Royal Navy Commander who now wrote for the Observer, and was well known for a series of BBC radio broadcasts about 18th century erotica. He had written I, Libertine as a scholarly exercise, and it was to his surprise that his novel was enjoying such mainstream popularity.
</p>
<p>
The book was reviewed in national newspapers, and became a New York Times Bestseller. There were articles in Life, Newsweek, Time—it was so popular that it could not be found in any bookstore. Soon, Earl Wilson, the gossip columnist at the New York Post, was proudly writing about having lunch with Frederick Ewing and his wife, Marjorie. Students wrote research papers on Ewing, who had previously been completely unknown in the United States. Publisher Ian Ballantine, of Ballantine Books, was searching for the elusive Ewing and trying to secure the book’s paperback rights. And then, in perhaps the most telling signifier of I, Libertine’s popularity, the book was banned by the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
Jean Shepherd was entertained because I, Libertine did not exist. Nor did Frederick Ewing, his wife Marjorie, or Excelsior Press. All of it was a hoax Shepherd and his audience had concocted. He had directed his listeners to request I, Libertine at bookstores around New York, creating enough buzz around the title that no one suspected a hoax. Together they had exposed the Day People for what they really were: insipid, empty.
</p>
<p>
Day People—that was what Shepherd called the denizens of mainstream society, people who took things at face value and never bothered to think for themselves. Day People made lists, and believed in them: if a book were on a bestseller list, then it must have some merit. And by definition, Day People did not listen to his broadcast.
</p>
<p>
“At 3 am, the people who believe in lists are asleep,” he said. “Anyone still up at 3 am secretly has some doubts.”
</p>
<p>
These were his listeners, the Night People: “Night is the time people truly become individuals, because all the familiar things are dark and done, all the restrictions on freedom are removed,” he told the New York Times in the aftermath of I, Libertine. “Many artists work at night—it is peculiarly conducive to creative work. Many of us attuned to night are not artists but are embattled against the official, organized, righteous day people who are completely bound by their switchboards and their red tape.”
It was the Eisenhower era, a time of comfort, conformity, and other things Shepherd chafed against. Ideas of cultural subversion were beginning to emerge: Lenny Bruce, the Beats, Rebel Without A Cause. Shepherd’s late-night (or, early-morning) timeslot gave him the freedom to be subversive: his audience was small, and the station, WOR, didn’t especially care about what he was doing in that sweaty room at ungodly hours. He had the opportunity to make mischief in the dark.
</p>
<p>
In 1956, radio was in a state of transition. The Lone Ranger had ended its 23-year run; television was on the rise; disk jockeys were only just beginning to play with the format of talk radio. It was a good time to venture into the experimental, away from the carefully scripted radio shows of the time, and Jean Shepherd took advantage of his lengthy timeslot to tell meandering stories, largely improvised and unrehearsed. He talked about his childhood in Hammond, Indiana, during the Depression, and about the time he spent in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II. He delivered monologues on consumerism and commercialism and Day People and Night People. Between stories, he played jazz records and performed the occasional kazoo solo.
</p>
<p>
And his audience was devoted. When WOR threatened to cancel Shepherd, 400 listeners gathered in Manhattan in protest. By 1970, the New York Times described Shepherd’s fans as a “cult of intense proportions.”
An early listener named Bob Kaye recalls discovering Shepherd when his father told him about “this crazy guy on the radio that tells people to put their radios by an open window at 2 AM and then plays an incredibly loud record of a train, whistles and all, for five minutes.”
</p>
<p>
Donald Fagen, lead singer of Steely Dan, reflected on listening as a 12-year-old in 1960, when Shepherd’s show had been moved to a slightly earlier time: “Like legions of other sorry-ass misfits throughout the Northeast, I tuned in every weeknight at 11:15 and let Shep put me under his spell.”
</p>
<p>
Despite threats of cancellation, Shephard’s radio show continued until he finally left WOR in 1977. He wrote extensively, contributing to Mad Magazine and the Village Voice. He wrote stories for Playboy; these were collected in a book called In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, which became an actual bestseller and was later made into a movie, A Christmas Story, which Shepherd narrated but considered “schmaltzy.” It is now rebroadcast on TBS every year.
</p>
<p>
Jean Shepherd died in 1999. What now remains of his cultural legacy are nostalgic repetitions of a holiday movie—“I think nostalgia is one of the great sicknesses of America,” he once said—and legions of devoted fans who grew up with his radio show, and who continue to trade and collect tapes of his broadcasts.
</p>
<p>
A recording of the original 1956 show during which the idea for I, Libertine was conceived has yet to be found. The majority of what is now known of the hoax’s origins stems from a much later interview with Shepherd, in 1968, on the Long John Nebel Show.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what,” Shepherd recalled saying, one night in 1956. “Tomorrow morning, each one of us, we walk into a bookstore, and ask for a book that we know does not exist. Let’s just see what happens.”
He remembered telling his listeners to suggest a title. Calls poured in all night, from as far away as Alaska, he said, until finally at 4:30 am, he finally decided on I, Libertine. “Now that sounds like a book,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Shepherd explained that he had come up with the author, Frederick Ewing, and laughed as he remembered all the dignified British attributes he had invented for Ewing. 
</p>
<p>
“Frederick Roland Ewing,” he said. “He was a Lieutenant Commander in World War II on the North Atlantic, the Murmansk Run. He is now a civil servant in Rhodesia. He is married to Marjorie, a horse woman from the north country.”
</p>
<p>
He described how it was decided that the publisher would be Excelsior Press—“excelsior” was then one of his radio catchphrases—which was an imprint of Cambridge University Press.
</p>
<p>
“There is not a bookseller in the country that can argue with Cambridge,” he said. “Or a British author who’s married to a lady named Marjorie.”
</p>
<p>
After the hoax was exposed, Ian Ballantine was still interested. He tracked down one of Shepherd’s friends, a science fiction writer named Theodore Sturgeon. Sturgeon led Ballantine to Shepherd, and together with Ballantine’s wife, writer and editor Betty Ballantine, they wrote and published an actual novel called I, Libertine.
</p>
<p>
“It became a bestseller genuinely after that,” said Shepherd.
By then, the world had changed. The Day People had begun to think more critically. “I’m not saying I started it,” said Shepherd. “It was a whole series of forces that came together. That particular year was the beginning of a whole new attitude that people have today towards things which they never questioned.”
</p>
<br/>
<p>
It is a compelling story. From nothing, a literary success had sprung, and left the society of Day People reeling in its wake. It served as a lesson in critical analysis and independent thinking, and how you shouldn’t believe something just because someone respectable says it.
</p>
<p>
Here, then, is a continuation of the lesson: Jean Shepherd was a storyteller, and he was not above embellishment. The following can be verified: Jean Shepherd had a radio show on WOR in 1956, which was broadcast from Cateret, New Jersey. The signal was strong, and would have been received as far away as Pennsylvania. Some time in 1956, enough people went into bookstores to ask for a book called I, Libertine by Frederick Ewing that Ian Ballantine became interested. According to Shepherd’s biographer, Eugene Bergmann, Ballantine was aware of the hoax. He contacted Theodore Sturgeon, who put him in touch with Jean Shepherd. That September, Ballantine Books published a real I, Libertine with an initial press run of 130,000 copies.
</p>
<p>
There are no records of I, Libertine being mentioned in Life, Newsweek, or Time prior to the exposure of the hoax. The earliest extant newspaper article mentioning the book is from August 1, 1956, a story called “Night People’s Hoax On Day People Makes Hit With Book Folks,” by Carter Henderson. I, Libertine never appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List: in either of its incarnations, as a fake or as a genuine book, despite Shepherd’s claims otherwise. Most of I, Libertine’s supposed accomplishments—tricking Earl Wilson into fabricating a lunch date with Ewing, eliciting reviews from nationwide press—amount to nothing more than dubious myths originated by Shepherd himself. One of Shepherd’s anecdotes, that a university student had written a paper about I, Libertine and received a B+, is corroborated by a contemporaneous article in the Long Beach Independent. But that article also implies that the professor was a fellow Shepherd listener, and aware of the joke. But most modern retellings of the great I, Libertine hoax story take Shepherd at his word, and report his various narrative enhancements as entirely true. It seems, then, that Jean Shepherd has tricked the Day People once again.
