<p>BROOKLYN—Renaissance chateaux and Medieval castles inspired the picturesque facades of thousands of Crown Heights rowhouses, which housed some of Brooklyn’s wealthiest professionals in the late 1800s. A century of transformation followed—an influx of African-American southerners fleeing Jim Crow, two World Wars, suburbanization and white flight, the formation of communities of Caribbean immigrants and Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidim and their accompanying racial tension, decades of crime and urban decay followed by renewal and contemporary gentrification—but much of the old architecture remains well-preserved.</p>
<p>Longtime area resident Deborah Young, 63, is the president and chairperson of the Crown Heights North Association, a community initiative dedicated to preserving the neighborhood’s buildings and history.</p>
<p>“It’s brought us together as a community—not that we weren’t a community before,” said Young, a retired social worker. She and her neighbor, Denise Brown, founded the CHNA in 2001. “It’s helped to educate ourselves about the value of our homes.”</p>
<p>But some of those homes might be in danger. The ongoing pace of gentrification has brought a flood of new real estate projects, including 23 active developments, that alter the landscape of the neighborhood. Concerned about the preservation of old buildings, the CHNA and a number of other community and preservationist organizations have pursued city landmark designation.</p>
<p>The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is now in the process of granting landmark status to Crown Heights North Historic District III and its 640 buildings, an expansion of the already designated districts I and II, which contain 1082 buildings. Landmark designation places a set of restrictions on building alterations, demolitions, and new constructions, essentially putting a stop to any historically unfaithful aesthetic changes to the character of the district’s buildings.</p>
<p>“It protects the architectural jewels that we have here,” said Young.</p>
<p>However, some homeowners see landmark designation as a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Trevor Lyons, 68, stood in the garden entrance behind the stoop of the two-story Renaissance Revival brownstone he has owned since 1980. An ornate stone transom adorns the double-leaf doors of his main entrance, and carved garland motifs ornament his windows.</p>
<p>“It shoots your property up,” he said. “If you wanna rent, you get better rent. Only trouble is low income people being pushed out. It’ll price the ordinary family out of the market.”</p>
<p>Lyons said that when he bought his home 40 years ago, his family’s working-class income was just barely enough for mortgage payments. Now, he worries that a modern working-class family would be entirely unable to afford a similar home. In the past six months, comparable properties in the area have been sold for a median value of $605,000.</p>
<p>“We’re being plagued on a weekly basis by people who want to buy,” Lyons said. He believes that landmark designation would raise property values even higher, and inquiries from unwelcome buyers would only increase.</p>
<p>Simeon Bankoff, 43, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, disagrees.</p>
<p>“You know what causes gentrification?” he said. “Having beautiful homes that do not cost as much as other beautiful homes. It’s the market, it’s not landmarking.”</p>
<p>The Historic Districts Council is a New York City-based non-profit organization that advocates for the preservation of historic buildings and the neighborhoods that contain them. The HDC, along with the Municipal Art Society and New York Landmarks Conservancy, have been major supporters of the Crown Heights North Association’s initiatives.</p>
<p>Bankoff said that landmark designation could actually arrest the pace of gentrification.</p>
<p>“It’s a bulwark against new modern market-rate people moving in,” he said. “We are all very sensitive to the ‘lightening’ in certain parts of Brooklyn, but landmark designation is not a cause or symptom of gentrification.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some residents have more personal concerns about designation, like Theresa Edwards, who has lived in her own Renaissance Revival brownstone for the last 14 years.</p>
<p>“You really want to work on your own home as you please,” she said.</p>
