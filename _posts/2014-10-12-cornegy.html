<p>BROOKLYN—Robert E. Cornegy, Jr. has a history of being overshadowed. As councilmember for the 36th city council district, an expansive swath of central Brooklyn that spans the neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant and northern Crown Heights, he is inevitably tasked with following the footsteps of his predecessor, long-time politician Albert Vann. Vann, who served the area for 26 years as assemblyperson before filling the city councilmember seat for another 12, leaves behind a political legacy whose most insurmountable challenges appeared to have come in the form of term limitations.</p>
<p>According to Cornegy, Albert Vann “did more for the advancement of black people in the state of New York than anyone.” In 2013 article for <i>The Brooklyn Reader</i>, Cornegy himself wrote that “Vann’s work in the Assembly yielded significant advancements, from more black teachers in the classrooms in New York state (especially Central Brooklyn,) to ensuring an increased black presence on the bench in Kings County courts, to adding more black elected officials to the rolls [sic] of the city, state and federal governments.”</p>
<p>In other words: no pressure.</p>
<p>This isn’t Cornegy’s first encounter with grand expectations. Thirty years ago, Cornegy—then called Rob, not Robert—played forward-center for St. John’s University's men’s basketball team as they came the closest they’ve ever been to a national championship. They wore bright red uniforms with bold white zigzag patterns (this was, after all, 1985) and appeared in the Final Four, where they ultimately lost to Georgetown and ended what the university’s sports blog has called a “storybook season.”</p>
<p>But the story did not end there for the twelve young men on the roster: shooting guard Chris Mullin played alongside Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson in the 1992 Olympics; starting center Terry Bross switched sports and pitched for the New York Mets; and coach Lou Carnesecca had an arena named after him. Meanwhile, Rob Cornegy took another direction and turned towards politics.</p>
<p>Like the task of replacing Albert Vann, basketball for Cornegy was more of an external mandate than a self-chosen vocation. In 1985, Cornegy told <i>New York Times</i> reporter William C. Rhoden, “I started playing when I was a freshman in high school, mostly because guys in the neighborhood figured I should play.”</p>
<p>At nearly seven feet tall, Cornegy towers over famously altitudinous Mayor Bill de Blasio; it is easy to see how his physicality may have contributed towards his basketball career, even if his passions lay elsewhere. Carnesecca’s 1985 assistant coach Ron Rutledge told Rhoden that “there was never any question about Rob’s potential, what we questioned was how badly he wanted it.”</p>
<p>Despite his lukewarm attitude towards the game, Cornegy went on to play professional basketball in Israel and Turkey for nearly ten years. Upon returning to New York and entering the realm of politics, it continued to remain unclear whether Cornegy’s decisions were really his own.</p>
<p>Cornegy had been following in Albert Vann’s footsteps even before the former’s election to the city council. Cornegy served as District Leader of the 56th Assembly District, the same office where Vann had spent 26 years. In 2012 he succeeded Vann as president of VIDA, the Vanguard Independent Democratic Association, an historic Democratic club co-founded by Vann and credited with galvanizing Central Brooklyn’s voter base into electing Vann to the Assembly in 1975, essentially jump-starting his political career.</p>
<p>Cornegy’s association with Vann and VIDA led to accusations of being a machine candidate during the 2013 city council elections.</p>
<p>“It just so happens that at some point I became a member of the Vanguard Independent Democratic Association,” he told DNA Info in March 2013, in an attempt to deny these accusations.</p>
<p>His then-opponent Kirsten John Foy proceeded to released a statement complaining that “some seem to be fixated on the machine politics of old,” a clear criticism of Cornegy.</p>
<p>In April of that year, Cornegy gained support from both Albert Vann and Annette Robinson, Vann’s successor in the Assembly: a political family reunion. The endorsements solidified the election’s status as a decision between an outsider, Foy—famously arrested alongside Councilmember Jumaane Williams during a 2011 demonstration, and an insider—Cornegy.</p>
<p>Since his election, however, Cornegy’s voice has become stronger: his political achievements have been significant, especially for a freshman council member. A father of six children, including one with special needs, Cornegy has become an advocate for children’s issues. He was the lead sponsor for Avonte’s Bill, which called for audible school alarms and was recently signed into law by De Blasio. He also unveiled Brooklyn’s first community breastfeeding station, a quiet room inside Bed-Stuy’s Restoration Plaza furnished with chairs and a refrigerator for breast milk.</p>
<p>Dr. Clive E. Neil, pastor at Bedford Central Presbyterian Church, is optimistic about the new council member.</p>
<p>“In terms of relevance, Cornegy connects to young people,” he said. "Vann was just a different era."</p>
