<p>NEW YORK—Located on the second floor of New Kam Man, a supermarket in Manhattan’s Chinatown, is a room populated almost exclusively by young women and an occasional disinterested boyfriend. A wide space overlooking Canal Street, this room contains one of the city’s biggest and most comprehensive collections of beauty products imported from East Asia: false eyelashes from Taiwan, night serums from Korea, special socks from Japan that claim to help the wearer burn fat.</p>
<p>A few waiguoren—non-Asians, identified colloquially as “foreigners” despite this store’s location in non-Asian-majority country—filter in and out, but it’s obvious that there’s a very specific market being served here: the majority of customers are Chinese or Chinese-American. When it comes to makeup and skincare, one particular word seems to pop up on everything: “white.” From creams and cleansers to serums and masks on the cosmetics aisles, claims of skin whitening are prominently featured.</p>
<p>Bihaku, or “Beautiful Whiteness,” is a marketing term developed in the 1990s in the Japanese skincare industry. In Mandarin Chinese, the phrase is pronounced meibai, but written using the same characters—the same characters that are now plastered liberally on any product that purports to lighten a user’s skin. Like the terms “moisturizing” and “anti-aging,” bihaku is often claimed by products with dubious efficacy in terms of skin lightening. But many others contain arbutin or niacinamide, as well as potentially harmful (and effective) compounds like hydroquinone.</p>
<p>Pale skin is a standard for feminine beauty throughout much of Asia, where economic development has been accompanied by a growing cosmetics industry—and a demand for skin lightening products: in Pakistan, the tagline “Dark Out, White In” appeared on an ad for a lightening face cleanser; in Japan, luxury brand SK-II features a “Whitening” line of products; in Southeast Asia, lightening products for women’s pubic areas are advertised and sold. Market research firm GIA predicted that the global skin lightening industry will be worth $10 billion in 2015, with the majority of growth coming from the Asia-Pacific sector.</p>
<p>Growth is also happening in the United States, as Asian skincare products become more popular. New Kam Man might soon have online competition. A number of Internet startups are now trying to enter the market for Asian cosmetics, including the New York City-based Peach and Lily, an e-commerce site for Korean beauty products. Its founders were named “K-Beauty ambassadors” by Elle Korea. But ambassador status only serves to highlight the company’s American origins, as well as its visibility in American media.</p>
<p>Here’s where some awkwardness arises. Asian cosmetics are dominated by skin whitening products. In Asia, skin whitening does not necessarily take on a racialized context. In the United States, it does.</p>
<p>The Peach and Lily site features a Mizon-brand night mask, called “Good Night White Sleeping Mask.” It has whitening effects, but the product description steers conspicuously clear of actually using the word white. Under a section titled “Benefits,” the ingredients niacinamide, paper mulberry extract, and mulberry root extract are credited with the effects of “skin brightening” and “skin tone evening.” Niacinamide diminishes the transfer of melanosomes, which reduces the appearance of skin pigmentation; mulberry extracts contain arbutin, which inhibits melanin production. Both are staples of any whitening product’s list of active ingredients. The product name itself even contains the word “White”—but that’s the only place where that particular word is used.</p>
<p>In the United States, access to imported Asian beauty products has generally been limited to Asian-American retailers in immigrant communities. But around 2010, Korean cosmetics began to enter the American mainstream through the popularity of BB creams, a makeup product made prevalent in Asia through its use among Korean celebrities including actress Song Hye-kyo and the teenaged members of boyband SHINee. For decades South Korea, the pacesetter for Asian pop culture, has been producing a steady flow of fair-skinned actors and musicians. BB creams were widely marketed as a “secret of Korean actresses,” according to Koh Young-aah of the Korea Herald. The creams are purported to perform all the functions of moisturizer, primer, foundation, and sunscreen—at least, when they’re aimed at the Western market by an American brand like Maybelline or Clinique. In Asia, they claim one additional feature: skin whitening.</p>
<p>For the United States, a country essentially built on notions of racial inequity, the word “white” draws to mind a very specific concept: racial whiteness, and all the wealth and privilege that racial whiteness entails. For East Asia, whiteness is a bit complicated.</p>
<p>Everyday Beauty Supply is a small but brightly lit and well-stocked store on Hester Street, near the southern border between Chinatown and Little Italy. It supplies Korean and Japanese skincare and makeup products to a primarily Chinese consumer base.</p>
<p>Alice, who did not wish to provide her last name, is a diminutive 26-year-old who looks to be about 12. She is a recent transplant from mainland China, and a habitual user of skin whitening products; she made a handful of personal recommendations for various items at Everyday Beauty Supply.</p>
<p>“Chinese people think pale is beautiful,” said Alice. “Foreigners don’t care so much, they don’t care about covering themselves when they tan darker in the sun. But Chinese people? If you are pale, then you are beautiful.”</p>
<p>Paleness hasn’t always been a racialized concept in East Asia, where the preference for pale skin predates colonialism and Western contact. Texts from Gojeoseon, an ancient Korean kingdom, describe “flawless skin like white jade.”  Zhou dynasty paintings of Wu Zetian, China’s only ruling empress, portray her as especially pale. In China, skin tone became associated with class status: dark, tanned skin evoked images of the agrarian working class, while light skin signified nobility. This stratification has remained constant: wealthier Asian women possess greater access to skin lightening products.</p>
<p>At the same time, the effects of colonialism and imperialism cannot be easily ignored.</p>
<p>Western influences arrived in the Far East at full tilt, playing a major role in shaping the modern identities of ancient nations. Japan was forced to open trade with the west in 1852, when Commodore Matthew C. Perry, an American accompanied by a squadron of warships, showed up at what is now Tokyo Bay. His incursion later served as one of the primary catalysts for the Meiji Restoration, an era during which Western ideas—not only science and politics but also culture and fashion—fueled the rapid modernization of Japan. To “catch up” with the military power demonstrated by Perry, the Meiji government hired hundreds of o-yatoi gaikokujin—American and European artists, scientists, and military instructors—as highly-paid government advisors. A group of leading Japanese intellectuals formed the Meiji Six Society, meant to “promote civilization and enlightenment” through Western ideas.</p>
<p>Naturally, imperialism was one of those ideas. In 1875, the Empire of Japan staged its own version of the Commodore Perry incident at Ganghwa Island, on the west coast of Korea. As a result, the formerly isolated Korea was strong-armed into opening trade with Japan. Ganghwa represented the first in a series of Japanese military exploits meant to expand Japan’s dominance in Asia; Korea was formally annexed by Japan in 1910, and would remain under Japanese control until the end of the Second World War. Occupied Korea was also subject to the touting of Western values by its Japanese rulers. Sungkonghoe University’s Yoo Sun-Young describes a distinct Korean desire for western modernity: that even the Japanese “were not free from the inferiority complex of the non-white, non-western and late-modernized status,” and Koreans sought to distinguish themselves from Japanese colonizers through a question of “who was to become more western and modern faster, fulfilling an imagined comparative advantage.” A trend soon emerged: the phenomenon of “modern boys” and “modern girls,” Koreans who embraced Western styles and fashions. Among them were Korean flappers, who modeled themselves after American actress Clara Bow. But this kind of “modernization” was, for the most part, purely superficial: an important aspect of American flappers was participation in the unfettered bourgeois consumerism of the era; Korean flappers were too poor for any of that.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, suffered a series of military defeats by better-equipped Western countries. In 1843, after losing the First Opium War to Britain, China ceded the island of Hong Kong to British rule and opened four port cities, including major metropolis Shanghai, to British trade. This marked the beginning of what many historians in the People’s Republic of China now refer to as bainian guochi, the “century of national humiliation,” during which Western countries and Japan used gunboat diplomacy to chip away at China’s sovereignty. By the early 20th century, at the end of the Qing dynasty, Shanghai had become a nexus of Western culture: American movies were shown at theatres and fashionable women wore high heels. And across China, nearly half of its geographic expanse was now part of a Western or Japanese sphere of influence. For China, a nation literally named “middle kingdom,” to no longer be the axis around which the rest of the world revolved was an irreversible identity shift.</p>
<p>For the most part, East Asia never experienced the degree of Western colonization to which South and Southeast Asia had been subjected. But the age of imperialism left the region changed: divested of traditional identity and struggling for political recognition from Western powers, the nations of East Asia would spend the next decades desperately trying to modernize, Westernize, and—ultimately—whiten.</p>
<p>Back, for a moment, to Everyday Beauty Supply:</p>
<p>Alice paused in front of a display of various Korean snail cream products—one of the most recent trends in Korean skincare involves products that contain “snail enzyme,” supposedly extracted from the shells of snails. She opened one of the tester items, a brilliant white lotion in an ornate glass jar, and dipped her little finger inside. This, she explained, is one of the best and most effective whitening creams. The corresponding price tag is rather heavy.</p>
<p>(“Snail enzyme is the latest beauty craze to come out of Korea and Europe,” says the Peach and Lily website, which adds: “although it’s been used in Europe for many years,” perhaps in an echo of imperial-era reverence for European technology.)</p>
<p>Alice denied believing that having white skin will make her appear more Caucasian.</p>
<p>“This makeup is very pink,” she said, picking out a bottle of foundation and taking it down from the shelf. “If I wanted to look more foreign, I would use pink makeup.”</p>
<p>She dabbed the pink foundation on her wrist. It did, in fact, look far too pink for her skin tone.</p>
<p>“Foreigners don’t care about being white,” she said. “Some of them even like to be tan.”</p>
<p>The Western predilection for tanned skin is a relatively new development. Historically, paleness was associated with beauty in the West as well as in the East: skin lightness was an indicator of class status. During the Renaissance, a type of lead-based makeup known as Venetian Ceruse gained widespread use among the upper class, including Elizabeth I of England. The visual motif of the parasol often reappeared in paintings of wealthy women, reinforcing their pale skin and their avoidance of sun tanning. American women in the 19th century consumed arsenic wafers, which poisoned and destroyed their red blood cells to create a pale complexion.</p>
<p>A 1902 Sears Roebuck catalog features an advertisement for a product called Dr. Rose’s French Arsenic Complexion Wafers. The ad promises that the wafers will remedy “even the coarsest and most repulsive skin and complexion,” and to cure “yellow or muddy skin, and other facial disfigurements.” The wafers are, of course, also proclaimed to be “perfectly harmless.”</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 20th century, however, industrialization had completely shifted the landscape of the European working class. They weren’t farmers any more: now, they were factory workers. So, in 1923, when Coco Chanel accidentally got a sunburn, paleness was no longer as strong an indicator of wealth as it had been in previous eras. Chanel, by then already an established designer of high-end couture, introduced suntanned skin as a beauty ideal. Presently, according to the Food and Drug Administration, the American tanning salon industry is worth $5 billion.</p>
<p>Young Um is a slender 20-year-old woman with long dark hair and a taste for black clothing that accentuates the paleness of her face. She stood behind the register at Tonymoly, a skincare and makeup retailer on 32nd Street in Manhattan’s Koreatown, which has now been in operation for four months.</p>
<p>“Whitening lotions are not to make your skin whiter,” she said. “They make your skin more pure.”</p>
<p>She denied that there was any sort of racial aspect to the product.</p>
<p>“Race doesn’t matter,” she said, on whether any particular race especially preferred the whitening products. Though most customers at the store are Asian, Um said that the popularity of whitening products is not limited to Asian consumers.</p>
<p>“All races use them,” she said.</p>
<p>She gestured towards a particular product—a face cream housed inside an oblong plastic jar, shaped like a cartoon panda. The product is called Panda’s Dream White Magic Cream.</p>
<p>“A black woman just bought that panda,” she said. “For dark eye circles, just one hour ago.”</p>
<p>Um said that she did not use whitening products.</p>
<p>“I don’t really have—“ she said, and began to gesture towards her face. She did not finish her sentence.</p>
<p>Um appeared to be naturally pale, and seemed quite proud of her genetic disposition for fairness. She denied ever using fake tanning products, or even having the desire to try them. Her coworker, Min Kim, is the same age. But he doesn’t share her preference for pale skin.</p>
<p>“During summertime I’ll tan,” he said. “I’d prefer tan than being white. I think it looks better on me.”</p>
<p>In the United States and Europe, the legacy of skin whitening—and the fetishization of light skin—has a long history that isn’t completely predicated on class distinctions. Coco Chanel, even while sporting a fashionable tan, was still a white woman catering to a predominantly white clientele. The darkening of her skin tone doesn’t represent much of a disruption to the system of power and privilege that upholds white supremacy. During the Scramble for Africa, when rival European powers rushed to invade and colonize the African continent, European beauty standards began to draw on the white populace’s desire to distinguish themselves from inhabitants of the “dark continent.” Drexel University’s Yaba Blay writes that  “lest they themselves be associated with blackness, and all of the connotations it assumed, Europeans became invested in the process of cleansing the skin,” and that “in this way, soap became an agent of the colonial agenda itself.” An 1899 advertisement for Pear’s Soap features images of a European conqueror handing a bar of soap to to a kneeling African man, and the words “The first step towards lightening the White Man’s burden is through teaching the virtues of cleanliness.”</p>
<p>Young Um isn’t too interested in tanning.</p>
<p>“I just don’t like to tan,” she said, trying to explain herself. “I don’t look good. I look like some kind of… tribe.”</p>
<p>“Tribe?” asked Kim.</p>
<p>“You know what I mean,” said Um.</p>
<p>Kim smiled. “You mean like some kind of tribal warrior?”</p>
<p>“You know what I mean,” said Um.</p>
