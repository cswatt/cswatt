<p>BROOKLYN—Two teenage girls squealed as Donna Brown dabbed samples of her homemade shea moisturizer onto their wrists.</p>
<p>“It’s all organic,” she said, adjusting her periwinkle headwrap.</p>
<p>Brown, 41, owns Damselfly Skincare, a two-year-old Crown Heights boutique spa, a narrow lavender-scented room decorated with accent furniture. Brown said that after twenty-five years in the beauty industry, it was time to set off on her own.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to be in someone else’s space. I wanted to be in my space.”</p>
<p>Noticing the neighborhood’s ongoing economic boom, she chose a retail location on Nostrand Avenue. A few years ago, Damselfly might have seemed out-of-place in a neighborhood full of bodegas and storefront churches.</p>
<p>But gentrification has come to Crown Heights. Recently, a <i>New York Times</i> trend piece noted that condo and land prices have doubled in the last two years; moreover, Crown Heights warranted a <i>New York Times</i> trend piece. There are twenty-three active residential developments, including one luxury condo with a retail space that will introduce the neighborhood’s first Starbucks.</p>
<p>However, multinational enterprises have not been the only ones setting up shop in the area: Damselfly is part of a growing number of local businesses owned and operated by women of color. In 2013, an American Express OPEN report found that since 1997, the number of new businesses owned by women of color has increased by 155.8%—three times higher than the national average.</p>
<p>On the same block, restaurant Meme’s Healthy Nibbles opened in May. Proprietor Mery Gueye started her first Meme’s in Prospect Heights sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>“I just needed to expand,” she said, surveying a menu of items with names like <i>I Am Peaceful</i> and <i>I Am Amazing</i>.</p>
<p>Gueye, 46, said that her race, gender, and Senegalese accent made it especially difficult to start a business. According to the National Women’s Business Council, the average woman-owned business receives only half the new financial capital the average man-owned business receives—and raising capital is not the only challenge.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to rent to you. They just have this idea of who they want to rent to, maybe a white man.”</p>
<p>Across the street, Jyll Hubbard-Salk expressed her frustration with gentrification.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I think it sucks,” she said. “Don’t come in from Manhattan with a ton of money and change things. Bring stuff to the community.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, Hubbard-Salk founded Urban Asanas, a terraria-adorned yoga studio perched atop a Jamaican restaurant. Hubbard-Salk said she wants to bring diversity into the yoga world.</p>
<p>“It’s beyond color, it’s class,” she said. “Yoga doesn’t have to be blonde, blue-eyed, decked out in Lululemon.”</p>
<p>She noted the growing number of women-owned neighborhood businesses—in addition to Brown and Gueye, there’s Debbie Hardy of boutique Martine’s Dream, and Dietra Wyche of natural hair salon Bohemian Soul. New York City contains the highest number of women-owned businesses in the country.</p>
<p>“The thing about it, it’s black women. I don’t know if it’s a trend, but it’s a nice trend to have.”</p>
