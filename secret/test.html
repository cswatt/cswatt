		Conventionally, one might assume that wealthy countries just do better at the Olympics. This is not an unreasonable assumption but there are a few things to consider. How does one measure wealth? GDP is certainly one indicator of a country's economic strength. It isn't perfect, but it's very much available, and this is a demo. So we're going with that one.
		<br/><br/>
		From a cursory glance at data from London 2012 (considering, of course, that results from Rio 2016 are not yet available because we can, so far, only travel in one direction in time) there is some information that confirms our hypothesis. The following five countries won the most medals: United States, China, Russia, Great Britain, and Germany. These, generally, are countries with fairly strong economies. 
		<br/><br/>

		But then we see that Hungary has won the same number of medals as Canada. Of the countries that won medals at the London Olympics, Hungary has a relatively low GDP. Another anomaly to note: Kazakhstan won the same number of medals as New Zealand. India, despite having the 3rd largest GDP, only won 6 medals, less than Ethiopia. 
		<br/><br/>
		And now we've got a chart where countries are ranked in order based on GDP, and then the bar above would theoretically represent which medals that country has won. Note: GDP data for North Korea not available. But they did win six medals.

		Something else to look at: which sports/events tend towards wealthy countries? Weightlifting is somewhat known in this regardâ€”weightlifting medals are often awarded to participants from developing countries. Other sports, especially those with high participation costs, are only historically won by wealthy countries e.g. equestrian.
