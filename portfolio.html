<p>The news out of Syria, however grim, includes at least one encouraging note. In northern Syria, along the Turkish border, has emerged a de facto autonomous region known as Rojava. The enclave is engaged in a brave and for the time being successful fight for self-governance and independence against considerable odds.<a href="http://techonomy.com/2015/08/staunch-syria-enclave-holds-off-isil-and-finds-support-online/"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
<a href='http://techonomy.com/2015/08/will-digital-tech-create-a-new-labor-movement/'>Will Digital Tech Create a New Labor Movement?</a>
<p>The American labor movement is finally starting to go online. It was born from the shifting economic environment created by the Industrial Revolution—and we are, once again, at a technological turning point: this time, change is driven across transistors rather than by steam engines. Labor issues are as much in flux as any part of the economy <a href="http://techonomy.com/2015/08/will-digital-tech-create-a-new-labor-movement/"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
<a href='stories/women'>In rapidly-gentrifying Crown Heights, new businesses emerge—owned by black women</a>
<p>Donna Brown, 41, owns Damselfly Skincare, a two-year-old Crown Heights boutique spa, a narrow lavender-scented room decorated with accent furniture. Brown said that after twenty-five years in the beauty industry, it was time to set off on her own. <a href="stories/women"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
<a href='stories/historic'>Crown Heights: Who Landmarks the Landmarks?</a>
<p>Renaissance chateaux and Medieval castles inspired the picturesque facades of thousands of Crown Heights rowhouses, which housed some of Brooklyn’s wealthiest professionals in the late 1800s. A century of transformation followed—an influx of African-American southerners fleeing Jim Crow, two World Wars, suburbanization and white flight, the formation of communities of Caribbean immigrants and Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidim and their accompanying racial tension, decades of crime and urban decay followed by renewal and contemporary gentrification—but much of the old architecture remains well-preserved. <a href="stories/historic"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
<a href='stories/cornegy'>After decades of Albert Vann, Robert Cornegy Jr. tries his hand at representing Bed-Stuy.</a>
<p>Robert E. Cornegy, Jr. has a history of being overshadowed. As councilmember for the 36th city council district, an expansive swath of central Brooklyn that spans the neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant and northern Crown Heights, he is inevitably tasked with following the footsteps of his predecessor, long-time politician Albert Vann. Vann, who served the area for 26 years as assemblyperson before filling the city councilmember seat for another 12, leaves behind a political legacy whose most insurmountable challenges appeared to have come in the form of term limitations. <a href="stories/cornegy"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
<a href='stories/skin'>Beautiful Whiteness: Race, Skin, and Skincare</a>
<p>Located on the second floor of New Kam Man, a supermarket in Manhattan’s Chinatown, is a room populated almost exclusively by young women and an occasional disinterested boyfriend. A wide space overlooking Canal Street, this room contains one of the city’s biggest and most comprehensive collections of beauty products imported from East Asia: false eyelashes from Taiwan, night serums from Korea, special socks from Japan that claim to help the wearer burn fat. <a href="stories/skin"><i><b>(...)</b></i></a></p>
