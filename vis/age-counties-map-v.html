<p>
Median age of US Counties, mapped; darker colors correspond to higher median ages. This was done as an excuse to play with maps in D3 and to poke around the US Census Bureau.

<p>
The median age of each county in the United States was taken from the <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">2010 Census</a>.
